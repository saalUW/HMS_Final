# Code Refactoring: Model Output Valuation # 
## Team members: Sameer Ali, Ana Pereda
## Format: Refactoring a piece of existing code (Option 2)
## Overall Goal: 

To create an R script that simulates a population, disease incidence, mortality data and vaccine coverage and then automates validation of model valuation 

## Detailed Plans and timeline:

# How to Run #

## Simulation ##
If running a simulation, run the Simulation.R script which will autopopulate the test_files

## Test Files ##
If including preprocessed data, add the following files:
* mu.csv = Mortality Rate
* VXCoverage.csv = Vaccine Coverage
* incidence.csv = Incidence
* population.csv = Population
* model_out.csv = Model Output

#Running Validation #

Run code
